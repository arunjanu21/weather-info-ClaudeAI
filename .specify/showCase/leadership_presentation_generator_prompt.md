# Leadership Presentation Generator - Use This Prompt in Your Project Folder

## PROMPT TO RUN IN YOUR PROJECT DIRECTORY

```
I need you to analyze this project comprehensively and create executive-level presentation materials for leadership. I successfully delivered this fully functional application using GitHub's Spec-Driven Development methodology WITHOUT writing a single line of code manually.

### Analysis Instructions:

1. **Read and Analyze All Project Artifacts:**
   - `.specify/memory/constitution.md` - Project principles and governance
   - `.specify/specs/[feature-number]-*/spec.md` - Functional specifications
   - `.specify/specs/[feature-number]-*/plan.md` - Technical implementation plan
   - `.specify/specs/[feature-number]-*/tasks.md` - Task breakdown
   - `.specify/specs/[feature-number]-*/data-model.md` - Database schema
   - `.specify/specs/[feature-number]-*/contracts/` - API specifications
   - All generated source code files
   - Git commit history to show the progression

2. **Extract Key Metrics:**
   - Total lines of code generated (by language)
   - Number of files created
   - Number of user stories implemented
   - Number of API endpoints created
   - Database tables and relationships
   - Test coverage (if applicable)
   - Time from project start to working application
   - Number of manual code edits (should be zero or minimal)

3. **Create Comprehensive Presentation Package:**

   **A. PowerPoint Presentation (10-12 slides):**
   
   Slide 1 - Executive Summary
   - Project name and purpose
   - Key achievement: Zero-code development
   - Time to delivery
   - Technology stack used
   
   Slide 2 - The Challenge & Opportunity
   - Traditional development constraints
   - The Spec-Driven Development proposition
   - Why this matters for our organization
   
   Slide 3 - Traditional SDLC vs. Spec-Driven Development
   Create a comparison table:
   | Phase | Traditional Approach | Spec-Driven Approach |
   |-------|---------------------|---------------------|
   | Requirements | 2-3 weeks | 2-3 hours |
   | Design | 1-2 weeks | 1 day |
   | Development | 6-8 weeks | 1-2 days |
   | Testing | 2-3 weeks | Automated |
   | Deployment | 1 week | Same day |

   - Live demo walkthrough (5-7 minutes)
   - Code quality showcase (2 minutes)
   - Metrics reveal (2 minutes)
   - Q&A preparation (anticipated questions)

   Anticipate and prepare answers for:
   - "How reliable is AI-generated code?"
   - "What about security concerns?"
   - "Can this work for enterprise-scale applications?"
   - "What are the limitations?"
   - "How does this affect developer roles?"
   - "What's the learning curve for teams?"
   - "How do we maintain and update AI-generated code?"

   - Speaker notes (what to say)
   - Data/metrics to display

5. **Include Real Examples from This Project:**
   
   Reference actual:
   - User stories from spec.md
   - Architecture decisions from plan.md
   - Generated file names and structure
   - Actual metrics from the codebase
   - Specific examples of quality decisions

### Output Format:

Organize the output as follows:

1. PRESENTATION_SLIDES.md - Full slide deck content
2. EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md - One-page summary
3. DEMO_SCRIPT.md - Detailed demo walkthrough
4. QA_PREPARATION.md - Questions and answers
5. METRICS_DASHBOARD.md - Visual metrics layout
6. TALKING_POINTS.md - Key messages and elevator pitch

### Special Requirements:

- Use actual data from this project (not placeholders)
- Emphasize the "zero manual coding" achievement
- Focus on business outcomes over technical details
- Make it executive-friendly (avoid deep jargon)
- Include visual descriptions for all charts/graphs
- Provide specific examples that demonstrate quality
- Calculate real ROI based on typical project costs
- Position this as innovation leadership opportunity

### Context About Me:
- Role: Application Development Associate Manager
- Experience: 16 years in IT industry
- Expertise: Angular (8 years), .NET/SQL (7 years)
- Company: [Your Organization]
- Audience: Associate Directors (leadership team)
- Goal: Showcase innovation, efficiency, and potential for org-wide adoption

Please analyze all project artifacts and generate comprehensive presentation materials that will impress leadership and demonstrate the transformative potential of Spec-Driven Development for our organization.

### Additional Output Requirement:

6. **Create a Simulation/Example Output:**
   
   For EACH deliverable (Presentation Slides, Executive Summary, Demo Script, Q&A, Metrics Dashboard, Talking Points), provide a COMPLETE simulation showing EXACTLY what the output should look like with REAL data from this project.
   
   The simulation should:
   - Use actual project names, technologies, and metrics
   - Include realistic numbers based on code analysis
   - Show complete examples (not placeholders like "X weeks" or "[insert here]")
   - Demonstrate the level of detail and polish expected
   - Serve as a reference template that can be directly used or slightly modified
   
   Format the simulation clearly so I can distinguish between:
   - Instructions/explanations (how to create the content)
   - Actual example output (the finished content ready for presentation)
   
   This will help me understand the expected quality and format, and provide a strong starting point for my actual presentation materials.
